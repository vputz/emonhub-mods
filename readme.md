EMONHUB-MODS
------------

This is just a couple of emonhub modifications made to support
a few reporting tools.  So far it's very simple--just one
module to report to Hyperion (to set LEDs based on total current)
and one to report stats to Riemann for generic event manipulation.
I'm not really attempting to stay in sync with the actual emonhub
tool as this is just a personal flail to learn how to do some things.
